## Derivatives
- Power rule: d/dx[x^n] = nx^(n-1)
- Product rule: d/dx[f(x)g(x)] = f'(x)g(x) + f(x)g'(x)
- Chain rule: d/dx[f(g(x))] = f'(g(x))g'(x)

## Integrals
- Power rule: ‚à´x^n dx = x^(n+1)/(n+1) + C
- Substitution method for complex functions
- Integration by parts: ‚à´u dv = uv - ‚à´v du

## Applications
- Finding area under curves
- Optimization problems
